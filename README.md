# Readme Whetstone Benchmark â€“ **Modernized Edition** ðŸš€

Welcome to the **modernized Whetstone Benchmark**, a high-performance testing tool designed to measure the computational capabilities of your system with various data types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`). This version builds upon the classic 1998 C implementation of the **Whetstone Double Precision Benchmark** but now supports **template-based flexibility**, **multiple data types**, and better integration with modern compilers. Whether youâ€™re benchmarking simple arithmetic or heavy transcendental operations, this version has been reworked to reflect **modern hardware capabilities**.

## What's New? ðŸŒŸ

This isn't your grandma's Whetstone benchmark! Weâ€™ve taken the original double-precision-only implementation and **pimped it up** with the following new features:

1. **Templated Benchmark Class**:  
   Run benchmarks with `int`, `float`, `double`, or any other numeric type, thanks to C++ templates.

2. **Command-Line Control**:  
   Customize the loop count easily through command-line arguments to adjust the workload.

3. **Trigonometric and Arithmetic Operations**:  
   Our enhanced benchmark ensures that transcendental functions (like `sin`, `cos`, and `exp`) and arithmetic calculations are thoroughly tested.

4. **Modular and Clean Design**:  
   Clear class-based design to allow developers to extend or modify benchmarks easily.

5. **Optimized for Compiler Performance**:  
   Take advantage of modern compiler optimizations (e.g., `-O3`, `-ffast-math`) for better performance on todayâ€™s CPUs.

6. **SIMD Potential**:  
   Ready for future upgrades to use SIMD optimizations or lookup tables for transcendental functions.
